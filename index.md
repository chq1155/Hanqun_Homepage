## Welcome to CAO Hanqun's Personal Website!



### About Me

I am an undergraduate student from The Chinese university of Hong Kong (CUHK) Math Department. Now, I am focusing on research in **Bioinformatics**, **Computer Vision**, and **Medical Image Analysis**, which include protein design using deep generative model, sc ATAC-seq clustering & analysis, Medical image processing with Masked Image Modeling. Also, I am trying to do some pre-train NLP model due to my own interest. Now, I am working with Professor. Yu Li in CUHK CSE Department and Professor. Xiaomeng Li in HKUST EE Department with great honor.


### Past Projects

#### Summer Research supervised by Prof. Jun Zou (Chairman of CUHK Math Department)


Undergraduate Researcher, from May 2021 to October 2021

We designed a forward solver for the inverse coefficients in elastic wave scattering problem using [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) and implemented it with [FreeFEM](https://freefem.org/) and MatLAB.
