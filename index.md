## Research Projects

### Inverse Method for Elastic Wave Scattering
>May 2021 - September 2021. Summer research project, faculty of Science, CUHK.
- Supervised by Prof. Jun Zou (Chairman of Math Department).
- Gathered background knowledge including linear elasticity, Perfect Matched Layer (PML), and Finite Element Method of PDE. 
- Implemented forward solver for the inverse coefficients in elastic wave scattering problem using FreeFEM and MATLAB.
- Conducted further numerical experiments to find exact convergent stable solutions in the scattering wave problem.
